# Nonlinear difference equations
This Rstudio function allows you to study the stability of the equilibrium points of nonlinear difference equations, $x_{t+1} = f(x_t)$, where $f(x_t)$ is a non linear function such a polynomial. For example, this Rstudio function can analize the stability of the following difference equation: $x_{t+1} = \frac{x^3 + x^2 + 2x - 2}{x^2 + 1}$

Particularly, the function performs the following tasks:
- calculate the equilibrium points and identify whether it is a stable (locally asymptotically stable) or unstable equilibrium point
- graph the phase diagram and represent the trajectories, based on initial conditions
