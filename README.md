# Nonlinear difference equations
This Rstudio function allows you to study the stability of the equilibrium points of nonlinear difference equations. Particularly, the function performs the following tasks:
- calculate the equilibrium points and identify whether it is a stable (locally asymptotically stable) or unstable equilibrium point
- graph the phase diagram and represent the trajectories, based on initial conditions
$x_{t-1} = f(x_t)$
